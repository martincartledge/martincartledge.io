Computers were invented by Charles Baggage to perform defined procedures or algortithims. External factors in technology have changed, but the basic principle and utility of computers remain the same.

Things begin to get a bit abstract if we do not know each step in a sequenece to give to a computer though. What happens then? Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be us solve this problem.

## Weak vs Strong AI

I think it will be helpful to split two types of the AI we might see or hear about. Weak AI is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial recognition. Strong AI is designed to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

Weak AI is far more common in our normal day to day. Some common examples include:
- Siri
- Spotify recommendations
- Customer service chat bots

Strong AI can be thought of as a goal that the AI industry is striving towards. A strong AI could reason, understand, and learn just like a human could.


## Intellgence

What does intelligance mean to you? Critical or abstract thought? Superior awareness about yourself or the world around you? The ability to learn and adapt?

The irony here is that the definition of Intelligence is a bit of a mystery itself. It's hard to find a defintion that can be set as a standard. No standarized test or metric system can be used to measure or quaniify this concept in humans or any living organism.

Alan Turing created a way to potentially measure intelligence. The way his test worked was to have a human judge a conversation between a human and a machine. If the judge could not tell the difference between the two, the machine was considered intelligent.

## Thinking human

How would a computer think, act, or learn like you or I would? Conceptually, this starts with how humans think and understand. How can you tell the difference between a red and green? You don't consiously think about this, you just know. We learned this at some point, and a computer has to learn this as well.

The way computers learn is through models. A model is a representation of a system that is used to make predictions or decisions. The model is trained on data, and then used to make predictions on new data.

There are two ways to approach this problem:

1. **Top-down Approach: Symbolic Reasoning**:

2 **Bottom-up Approach: Neural Networks**:
