ðŸª´ _This is a living post, and will likely be updated periodically_

MapReduce was a revolutionary concept within the field of Distributed Systems, therefore, I felt it deserved its own post.

You might have heard of it in the past, and for good reason. The world's most popular search engine, Google, used MapReduce heavily for several years.

It is my goal of this post is to share the following key points:

- What is MapReduce
- How does MapReduce work
- Why use MapReduce

## What is MapReduce

> Programming model and implementation for processing and generating large datasets

MapReduce was created with the goal of processing hundreds of terabytes of data at scale. During the time of its inception, 2004, the industry was relying on hardware that simply could not keep up with the demand of processing big data.

The manner in which it performs this processing is split into two actions, you guessed it, mapping and reducing.

A map operation is performed on each _logical_ record derived from the input, a set of key/value pairs are composed, then a reduce operation is applied to _all_ values that _share the same key_.

When broken down into steps:

- A user specifies a `map` function:
  - Processes a key/value pair
  - A set of intermediate values associated with the same key is generated
- A user specifies a `reduce` function:
  - All values associated with the same key are merged
  - This operation is automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines

The run time system handles:

- Partitioning the input data
- Scheduling the programâ€™s execution across a set of machines
- Machine failures
- Managing the inter-machine communication

Inspired by the map and reduce primitives found in Lisp, among other functional programming languages

The goal: handle processing large sets of data at Google, while hiding parallelization, fault-tolerance, data distribution and load balancing.

The computation takes a set of input key/value pairs and returns a set out output key/value pairs.

MapReduce library is written in C++

## How Does MapReduce Work

There are many different ways to implement MapReduce, but for simplicity sake, I will provide an overview similiar to what Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat cited in their [MapReduce paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub62/).

- Large clusters are connected via Ethernet
- Each machine is equipped with dual-processor x86 processors
  - OS: Linux
  - Between 2-4 GB of memory per machine
- Commodity networking hardware is used
  - 100 megabits per second
  - 1 gigabit per second at the machine level
- Clusters consist of hundreds/thousands of machines
  - Failures are common
- Storage is handled in two primary methods
  - IDE disks attached to each machine
  - A distributed file system (GFS) that manages the data stored on the machine's disks
  - GFS uses replication to ensure data availability amidst unreliable hardware
- A user submits jobs to a scheduling system
  - Within each job are sets of tasks
  - These tasks are mapped by the scheduler to available machines within the cluster
