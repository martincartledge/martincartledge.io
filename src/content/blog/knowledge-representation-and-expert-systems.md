The core of artificial intelligence, is the pursuit of greater knowledge. The ultimate goal being that this knowledge is used to view the world as a human does.

When AI was first being evolved, the top down approach to creating systems was the prominent path. This involved getting knowledge from human experts of a topic and convert that information into a machine-readable format. The core principles of this approach are _Knowledge Representation_ and _Reasoning_.

## Knowledge Representation

> Knowledge represents our understanding of the world, and comes from an active learning process. The information we receive integrates into our personal model of the world.

What is the difference between knowledge and information? When you read a book are you reading knowledge or information?

The answer is information (or data). Knowledge is gained once we integrate the information or data we consume and integrate it with our own internal model.

There are four pillars that illustrate the relationship between knowledge and information:

- **Data**: Raw facts or numbers
- **Information**: Data that has been processed
- **Knowledge**: Information that has been integrated into our understanding
- **Wisdom**: Knowledge that has been applied

This pyramid and illustrative concept is called the [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid).
