These lists typically start with an emphasis on the great music released the year leading up until writing a best-of list. This year, I decided to do something a bit different. I have a list of my favorite albums, but only half of them were released this year. Music has been a source of joy, mental clarity, and therapy in many ways as far back as I can remember. The relationship between myself and the album I listen to continues to evolve.

When I was 10, I listened to "Weathered" by Creed (take it easy on me, lol). I still have fond memories of shoveling snow outside my home while listening to that album. It helped me go to another place in my mind and heightened the overall experience of being outside.

I have countless memories like this one. The beauty is that every song, album, and band has the power to transport the mind and put your mind into a state of recall that can be enlightening.

I digress. Here are the albums I listened to the most in 2024.

You will find some angry, some introspective, and some goofy and do not take themselves all too seriously. That is how life goes over the course of a year, month, or week. It is all about being present in life; not running from the good or the bad. Embrace the good and the bad times. There is always something to learn. Music has helped and continues to help me accept that.
