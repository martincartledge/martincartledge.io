### Intro to Machine Learning

#### What is Machine Learning?

> Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
Arthur Samuel, 1959

Programmed computer to play checkers against itself

The more opportunities you give an algorithm to learn, the better the outcome

Algorithms:

- Supervised learning
  - Used in real-world applications
  - Most innovation
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

### Supervised Learning

> Learns from being given the right answer, given an input x, it will predict the output y

Maps input x to output y

Applications:

- Spam filtering: Email: Input email, output spam or not spam
- Speech recognition: Audio: Input audio, output transcript
- Machine translation: English: Input English, output Spanish
- Visual inspection: Input: Image of phone, output defect or not defect

Algorithms: Regression and Classification

> Regression algorithm: Task to predict a number

Example: predicting house prices

> Classification algorithm: Task to predict a category (number, boolean, etc)

Example: Breast cancer detection, using medical records

Use size of tumor on one side of column, the other column is the diagnosis

Benign | Malignant, 0 | 1

Output class or category are the used interchangeably

Classification predicts a small number of possible outputs
